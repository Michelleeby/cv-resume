* Co-ordinated a cross team effort to refine internal tools to be customer-facing tools, bringing my previous responsibilities into my new role on Professional Services and successfully delivering the solution in under 3 months. It reduced annual support requests by 37%.  
* Invented internal tools that reduced time to delivery by 70% after leading an initiative to investigate a bottleneck in our product, interviewing the support staff who fielded most of the tickets as a result of this bottleneck.
