* Pitched, built, documented, and maintained our Professional Services internal engineering tooling that empowers our engineers as well as our non-technical team members to schedule tests and collect performance stats on any of our customers, automating an otherwise manual set of tasks. What used to take hours, is now accomplished in under a minute.  
* Led performance improvement engagements for our platform’s largest customers that have reduced their origin application’s average page response times by margins of 12% to 24%, leveraging performance profiling and analytics tools like New Relic, and designing and running large scale k6 load tests on Grafana Cloud.  
* Prevented application down-time for many large customers, like NASA. I analyzed and discovered a critical bug in their application that would have otherwise brought the site down during the [2024 Total Solar Eclipse](https://science.nasa.gov/eclipses/future-eclipses/eclipse-2024/).  
* Designed, developed, and executed [hackathons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon) for some of our platform’s largest customers. These are onsite engagements with the customer that have led to adoptions of our platform’s tooling or AOV expansions.  
* Discovered an improved caching strategy for one of our products, [Remote Data Blocks](https://github.com/Automattic/remote-data-blocks/pull/544), that reduced page response times by 34%, while also reducing our infrastructure costs for all of our hosted customers using it.
