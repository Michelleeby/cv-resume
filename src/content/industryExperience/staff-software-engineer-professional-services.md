* Designed and developed a PHP and React based internal CLI and dashboard application that automates performance testing and telemetry collection. Reduced workflow execution time from hours to \<60 seconds, enabling engineering and non-technical teams to self-serve complex diagnostic tasks.  
* Led performance initiatives that have reduced origin latency by margins of 12% to 24% across high traffic deployments. Implemented New Relic profiling and k6 Grafana Cloud distributed load testing to validate the solutions scale.  
* Conducted critical reliability analysis for enterprise-grade deployments (including NASA). Identified and patched a critical bug that would have caused application downtime during the 2024 Total Solar Eclipse traffic spike.  
* Led rapid prototyping initiatives for enterprise partners, architecting proof-of-concept solutions that validated platform capabilities. These technical, onsite deep-dives directly drove the successful integration of Gutenberg Blocks into client production environments.  
* Engineered a novel caching strategy for [Remote Data Blocks](https://github.com/Automattic/remote-data-blocks/pull/544) that reduced page response times by 34%, decreasing our global  infrastructure costs for the hosted fleet.
